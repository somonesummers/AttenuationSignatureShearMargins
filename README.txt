Model code developed in "Radar Attenuation Signature of Temperate Antarctic Shear Margins"
Paul T. Summers, Dustin M. Schroeder, Daniel F. May, and Jenny Suckale (in prep.)

Requirements
You must download and install the following: 

MEaSUREs matlab plug in + data files
	https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47329-measures
BedMachine matlab plug in + data files
	https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69159-bedmachine
cbrewer will greatly improve plotting
	https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/58350-cbrewer2

ALBMAP, Shen Geothermal data, and CReSIS data will auto-download for you upon first run using bash curl commands. 

Input
This code can be in run series using "thermalPocketRunner.m" 

Output
Running "thermalPocketRunner.m" as configured now will produce figures like figure 2 in the manuscript for each of the 4 radar lines discussed in the manuscript, returning full model results for each radar line.
