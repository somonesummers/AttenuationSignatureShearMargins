Model code developed in "Radar Attenuation Signature of Temperate Antarctic Shear Margins"


Requirements
You must download and install the following: 

MEaSUREs matlab plug in + data files
	https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47329-measures
BedMachine matlab plug in + data files
	https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69159-bedmachine
cbrewer will greatly improve plotting
	https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/58350-cbrewer2

ALBMAP and Shen Geothermal data, as well as CReSIS data will auto-download for you upon first run using bash curl commands. 

Input
This code can be in series using "thermalPocketRunner.m" 

Output
Running "thermalPocketRunner.m" as configured now will produce figures like figure 2 in the manuscript for each of the 4 radar lines discussed in the manuscript, returning full model results for each radar line.
